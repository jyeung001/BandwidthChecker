# Bandwidth Checker

This is a little class to perform a basic bandwidth test.  It is not complicated at all, which is probably why nobody bothered posting the code online, to write code to test for speed but I have to admit that is not extremely accurate.  The accuracy of the test depends on the size of the file being downloaded for the test, the larger the file the more accurate the test is but the longer it takes to complete.

TODO:
- Improve accuracy by doing multiple downloads of different files sizes
